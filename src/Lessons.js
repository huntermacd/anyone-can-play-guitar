      <h3>Lessons</h3>
      <p>There's a myriad of resources out there for learning a musical
        instrument. And an increasingly larger portion of which is free.
        So why take private lessons?</p>
      <p>It mostly depends on the student and how best they learn, but
        regardless of your preferred method there's still no substitute for
        having a person there with you to correct your mistakes and inspire your
        progress. I book lessons one month at a time, so even if you only need a
        short series to get you started I cater to that style.</p>
      <p>For the same reason, I don't teach from a method book, nor do I
        prescribe a specific practice regimen. Rather, I tailor my instruction
        to you, wherein I work as many of the tunes you want to learn as
        possible.</p>
      <p><em>Playing what you want to play...why do anything else?</em></p>
